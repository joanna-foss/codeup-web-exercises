    What is Test Driven Development?
    - The practice of writing tests before production code, then writing the code to make the tests pass.
    - Design technique and workflow that aims to use automated tests to provide feedback before and while the developer is working on implementation.
    - Will feel slow at first because of the learning curve and difference in approach, but highly effective in improving code quality.
